# Week 1
In week 1 I choice my final project: Control panels. I went for the control panels because I'm not really that good in CSS yet and wanted to start off with something that i could develop myself in more easilely, because there are so many options of control panels it seemed perfect.

I started off with a sketch of how i wanted it to look like and some features i knew how to make, then i turned the sketch in to a breakdown sketch, devining all the assets into HTML elements and a bit of styling. 

< here comes image of the sketch > 

Then after sketching I made my html, and css. 
So far the design excist out of the temperature ruler, some option radio buttons and a slider with a gradient feedback telling the user not only with degrees but also with colors from blue (cold) to red (warm).
